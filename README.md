# Hi, I'm Francisco Prieto 👋🏼🧑‍💻

I'm an electromechanical engineering pursuing a PhD in Data Science in the field of *Finance Optimization Strategies*. I'm passionated about share and learn about other peers, contributing to the community with new libraries or mothodologies.

Just now, I'm working on first library [pystrategy](https://pypi.org/project/pystrategy/).
