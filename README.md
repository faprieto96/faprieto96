# Hi, I'm Francisco 👋🏼

I'm an Electromechanical Engineering + MBA pursuing a PhD in Data Science in the field of *Financial Diversification Strategies*. I'm passionated about share and learn about other peers, contributing to the community with new libraries or mothodologies.

Just now, I'm publishing my first library [Pipoh](faprieto96.github.io/pipoh/intro.html).
